# Full-Stack Django & React POS System

## Overview

This project consists of a full-stack web application with a Django REST API backend and a React frontend.

### Backend

Located in the `backend/` directory, the Django server provides REST API functionality. It is structured to serve data to the frontend and handle all backend logic, including database interactions, authentication, and business logic.

### Frontend

Located in the `fronend/` directory, the frontend is a React application that consumes the REST API provided by the Django backend.

Each part of the application has it's own README file with more detailed information.
